# SNAF
Splicing Neo Antigen Finder (SNAF) is an easy-to-use Python package to identify splicing-derived tumor neoantigens from RNA sequencing data, it can 
predict, prioritize and visualize MHC-bound neoantigen for T cell (T antigen) and altered surface protein for B cell (B antigen).

# Input and Output

Simply put, user needs to supply ``a folder with bam files``, and the ``HLA type`` assciated with each patient (using your favorite HLA typing tool). And it will generate predicted immunogenic MHC-bound peptides and altered surface protein. Moreover, there's a myriad of convenient function that enables users to conduct survival analysis, association analysis and publication-quality visualiztion. Check our tutorials for more detail.
