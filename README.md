# SNAF
Splicing Neo Antigen Finder (SNAF) is an easy-to-use Python package to identify splicing-derived tumor neoantigens from RNA sequencing data, it can 
predict, prioritize and visualize MHC-bound neoantigen for T cell (T antigen) and altered surface protein for B cell (B antigen).

# Tutorial and documentation

See [Full Documentation](https://snaf.readthedocs.io).

Particulary, to avoid hassle, it is advisable to start a `fresh conda environment` with `python 3.7` on a `Linux system`, and use this specific git commit (I am actively
maintaining it) instead of the stable pypi version.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/frankligy/SNAF.git@e23ce39512a1a7f58c74e59b4b7cedc89248b908
```

# Input and Output 

Simply put, user needs to supply ``a folder with bam files``, and the ``HLA type`` assciated with each patient (using your favorite HLA typing tool). And it will generate predicted immunogenic MHC-bound peptides and altered surface protein. Moreover, there's a myriad of convenient function that enables users to conduct survival analysis, association analysis and publication-quality visualiztion. Check our tutorials for more detail.

# Auxiliary Programs developed within SNAF


- [RNA-SPRINT](https://github.com/frankligy/SNAF/tree/main/RNA-SPRINT): Infering splicing factor activity from RNA-Seq.


- [BayesTS](https://github.com/frankligy/BayesTS): BayesTS can infer tumor specificity for any features (gene, protein, splicing junction, etc).

- [DeepImmuno](https://github.com/frankligy/DeepImmuno): DeepImmuno can infer immunogenicity for peptide-MHC complex.
